Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a widely used medication for relieving mild to moderate pain and reducing fever. It's commonly employed to alleviate headaches, muscle aches, toothaches, and the discomfort associated with colds and flu. ​

Dosage and Administration

For adults, the typical dose is 500 mg to 1,000 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed, with a maximum of 4,000 mg within a 24-hour period. Exceeding this dosage can lead to severe liver damage. It's crucial to adhere to the recommended dose and avoid taking multiple medications containing paracetamol simultaneously. ​

Side Effects and Precautions

When taken as directed, paracetamol is generally safe for most individuals. However, potential side effects include allergic reactions such as skin rashes or swelling. Overdosing can result in serious liver damage, which may be fatal. Individuals with liver or kidney conditions, those who consume excessive alcohol, or those with low body weight should consult a healthcare professional before using paracetamol. ​
